Hey! I'm Artur Magalhães - feel free to call me Arthur as well :) - currently working as a Data Scientist Specialist at iFood in São Paulo. I previously worked at Amazon as a Data Scientist as well. While my professional life revolves around machine learning and data, there's much more that drives me.

I'm a passionate reader who enjoys books across economics, literature, history, politics, and mathematics – currently working through "Empire of AI" by Karen Hao, "The Left Hand of Darkness" by Ursula K. Le Guin, and "How to Solve It" by  George Polya. There's something fascinating about how different fields of knowledge connect and influence each other.

When I'm not reading or coding, you'll find me cheering for the Lakers (what a team!), training in boxing (Floyd Mayweather is the GOAT!), or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen – cooking has become another creative outlet I really enjoy. Music is essential too – Brazilian music, rap, and samba keep me energized throughout the day. I'm also a huge Star Wars fan and can easily spend hours discussing the universe or playing Battlefront 2.

What I love most about data science is that it sits at the intersection of all these interests: the analytical thinking, the strategic mindset, the creativity, and the storytelling. It's this blend that keeps me excited about both learning and building things that matter.
