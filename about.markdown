Hi there, I'm Arthur. I'm currently as Data Scientist at Amazon, in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I've been a ML intusiast since college and now I have the privilege to work with this exciting field.

Besides ML, I'm a huge basketball fans. Saturday mornings consist of playing it.
I love Star Wars and talking about it as well. I also can't live without music.
I enjoy brazilian music, rap, rock, punk and many others.
