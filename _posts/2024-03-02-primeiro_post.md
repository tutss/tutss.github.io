Hi there, I'm revamping my old blog to this new one.

Previously, I was using [pelican](https://getpelican.com/) with Travis CI to deploy it. Travis had a couple of changes over the years I'm now I too bored to
work on it. So I decided to try out Jekyll, after reading [Karpathy's blog](https://karpathy.github.io/). 

I am adding the old post I still find useful.

That's all folks!
